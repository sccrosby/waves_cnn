Data Processing
===============
(low) Extend to torch Dataset class instead of my own class
(low) rewrite data_processing protocols to be more efficient and properly handle tensors up front
        Ideally, this would properly vectorize time and tensors as well


Data Visualization
==================
replicate matlab and visualization schematics in python


CNN Model
=========
more versatile
hyperparameters
command line args
GPU handling
ISSUE: minibatch fetching is taking up ~45% of the time in training
database logging (Elliott's thing)
Flexible window


Model Input/Training
====================
Multiple Datasets
